Silver mappings from 4, 3 and 2 consensus votes by a panel of ontology matching algorithms from OM-2017. The data was provided by Ernesto Jimenez-Ruiz.

4 vote matches have highest confidence which can be used now for HP-MP and DOID-ORDO

HP-MeSH mappings shows that OM algorithms can cope with MeSH but there is much redundancy of label terms as expected. This maybe okay for some applications but problematic for others. If redundancy needs to be eliminated this can be done by 2 approaches:-

Method 1: Only the primary ID represents each heading term (class label) for the source MeSH which inputs to the algorithm.

Method 2: The redundancy is managed as a post-processing step after running the algorithm to filter the redundancy.
